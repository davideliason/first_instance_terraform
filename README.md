# using terraform to spin up AWS EC2 instance

I am working to learn Terraform and am using the great resourc, 'Terraform: Up and Running', 3rd edition, by Y. Brikman.
The hands-on learning that I am practicing here are based on the project described in chapter two of this book.

Note: The author suggests the following for VC:
git init
git add main.tf .terraform.lock.hcl
git commit -m "Initial commit"

and to add these to .gitignore:
.terraform
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
